## School Project: Streamlined Allergy Tracking Website

This project focused on developing a user-friendly website designed to simplify allergy tracking, especially for individuals who find traditional methods cumbersome or ineffective.  The site offers a streamlined and accessible platform to document allergy patterns, correlating them with various factors, including:

*   **Meal Components:** Users can log their meals and break down ingredients to identify potential triggers.
*   **Ease of use:** The site is deisgned to make logging fast, making it easier for futher logging, and sustained behavior.

The core goal of this project is to empower users to:

*   **Identify Potential Allergens:** By correlating allergy symptoms with food and environmental data, users can gain insights into potential triggers.
*   **Improve Allergy Management:**  The detailed tracking and analysis features facilitate proactive allergy management and informed decision-making regarding diet and lifestyle.

This website aims to provide a practical and efficient tool for individuals seeking to better understand and manage their allergies.

## Why 
My project is designed to combat allergies in our increasingly allergy-prone societies. This project aligns with the UN SDG goal, "Health and Well-Being" (Goal 3). Allergies negatively impact our health, causing deadly allergy attacks, pain, and decreased quality of life.  They hinder progress towards SDG 3. Reducing or preventing allergies, even to a small extent, would significantly advance this goal.

## My Action

To contribute to SDG 3, "Health and Well-Being," I am developing an allergy tracking app.  In recent years, my immune system and other bodily organs have experienced disharmony. I have suffered numerous allergy attacks, including hives and other less pronounceable reactions. To address these issues, I am creating an app where I can log my food intake and track allergy-related events. The app will provide a simple and quick journal to record what I'm eating, when I experience discomfort, and a tracker to correlate my diet, temperature, and weather conditions with these events.
