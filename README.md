# Project: App-Allergic-Prevention

## Background
This is a School project, I developed a user friendly website designed to simplify allergy tracking for individuals, particularly those who may find traditional methods cumbersome The site will allow users to easily document their allergy patterns, correlating them with common meal components and environmental factors like temperature. The goal is to provide a streamlined and accessible tool for identifying potential allergens and improving allergy management.

## Why 
My project is designed to combat allergies in our increasingly allergy-prone societies. This project aligns with the UN SDG goal, "Health and Well-Being" (Goal 3). Allergies negatively impact our health, causing deadly allergy attacks, pain, and decreased quality of life.  They hinder progress towards SDG 3. Reducing or preventing allergies, even to a small extent, would significantly advance this goal.

## My Action

To contribute to SDG 3, "Health and Well-Being," I am developing an allergy tracking app.  In recent years, my immune system and other bodily organs have experienced disharmony. I have suffered numerous allergy attacks, including hives and other less pronounceable reactions. To address these issues, I am creating an app where I can log my food intake and track allergy-related events. The app will provide a simple and quick journal to record what I'm eating, when I experience discomfort, and a tracker to correlate my diet, temperature, and weather conditions with these events.
