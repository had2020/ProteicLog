# Project: App-Allergic-Prevention

## School Project: Streamlined Allergy Tracking Website

This project focused on developing a user-friendly website designed to simplify allergy tracking, especially for individuals who find traditional methods cumbersome or ineffective.  The site offers a streamlined and accessible platform to document allergy patterns, correlating them with various factors, including:

*   **Meal Components:** Users can log their meals and break down ingredients to identify potential triggers.
*   **Ease of use:** The site is deisgned to make logging fast, making it easier for futher logging, and sustained behavior.

The core goal of this project is to empower users to:

*   **Identify Potential Allergens:** By correlating allergy symptoms with food and environmental data, users can gain insights into potential triggers.
*   **Improve Allergy Management:**  The detailed tracking and analysis features facilitate proactive allergy management and informed decision-making regarding diet and lifestyle.

This website aims to provide a practical and efficient tool for individuals seeking to better understand and manage their allergies.

## Why 
My project is designed to combat allergies in our increasingly allergy-prone societies. This project aligns with the UN SDG goal, "Health and Well-Being" (Goal 3). Allergies negatively impact our health, causing deadly allergy attacks, pain, and decreased quality of life.  They hinder progress towards SDG 3. Reducing or preventing allergies, even to a small extent, would significantly advance this goal.

## My Action

To contribute to SDG 3, "Health and Well-Being," I am developing an allergy tracking app.  In recent years, my immune system and other bodily organs have experienced disharmony. I have suffered numerous allergy attacks, including hives and other less pronounceable reactions. To address these issues, I am creating an app where I can log my food intake and track allergy-related events. The app will provide a simple and quick journal to record what I'm eating, when I experience discomfort, and a tracker to correlate my diet, temperature, and weather conditions with these events.

## Design
It is a rudimentary static site, in HTML, JS, and CSS, without any JS frameworks, such as React. This site is designed to be used fast, load fast, and work without too much complexity to reduce costs.  

# Allergy Tracking Web App - Project Structure

This document outlines the structure of the allergy tracking web application, detailing the purpose of each file and directory.

## Project Files

*   `.gitattributes`: Specifies attributes for files within the Git repository, used for git.

*   `LICENSE`: Contains the license under which the project is distributed. 

*   `README.md`: you're reading it!

*   `code.js`: Contains the core JavaScript logic for the dashboard page.

*   `dashboard.html`: The HTML file for the main user dashboard, where all the allergy journalling is done.

*   `favicon.png`: The icon displayed in the browser tab for the web application.

*   `index.html`: The main entry point for the web application, with intructions how to use the app.
  
*   `plan.html`:  The plan for the project.

*   `sdgpic.png`: An image file, potentially related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

*   `settings.html`: The HTML file for the user settings page. Here, users can likely manage their profile, notification preferences, allergy list, and other customization options.

*   `styles.css`: Contains the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules that define the visual presentation and layout of the web application. This file controls the look and feel of the app.

## File Relationships and Workflow

The HTML files (`index.html`, `dashboard.html`, `plan.html`, `settings.html`) provide the structure and content of the web pages.  `styles.css` styles these pages, and `code.js` adds interactivity and dynamic functionality.  Images like `favicon.png` and `sdgpic.png` are incorporated into the HTML.

A typical workflow would involve a user navigating to `index.html`, which might redirect them to `dashboard.html` after login.  From there, they could access `plan.html` to manage their allergy plan or `settings.html` to adjust their preferences.  `code.js` would handle user interactions and data updates across the dashboard, while `styles.css` ensures a consistent and appealing user interface.
