            <p>
                My project is made to combat allergies in our ever more
                allergy-prone societies. This project is made with the idea of
                following the UN SDG goal, health and well-being, goal numbered
                three. Allergies both plague our health, with deadly allergy
                attacks, and pain and discontent, from decreasing quality of
                life. Overall, allergies hinder progress towards the SDG goal of
                health and well-being. Stopping or even decreasing allergies,
                however slightly, would greatly advance this SDG goal.

            <h2 class="subtopic">My Action</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
                To act in aid of my SDG goal, "Health and Well-Being", I have
                decided to create my own implementation of an allergy tracking
                app. In recent years, my immune system and many bodily organs
                have been acting up, out of harmony. I have faced many allergy
                attacks, like hives, and many more I cannot pronounce. To solve
                these problems, or at least mitigate them, I have decided to
                make an app where I can log in. It should have an easy and fast
                journal of what I'm eating, when my stomach reacts, and a
                tracker where I can look up what was in my diet or the
                temperature and weather, which could have caused the event.
